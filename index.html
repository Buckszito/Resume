										<h2>More than 2 million South Africans lost their jobs during lockdown</h2>
										
										<div class="post_desc">
										
										
												<p>Stats SA has published its latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the second quarter of 2020, revealing that more than 2 million South Africans lost their jobs over the period.</p>
												<p>The number of employed persons decreased by 2.2 million to 14.1 million, Stats SA said. It added that the number of unemployed people also decreased by 2.8 million to 4.3 million over the quarter.</p>
												<p>However, it is important to note that Stats SA does not label those who are not employed and are not actively looking for a job as unemployed. Instead, these people are labelled as “Discouraged work seekers” and form part of the “Not Economically Active (NEA)” category.</p>
												<p>The number of people classified as “not economically active” increased by 5.6 million.</p>
												<p>“In spite of this massive decline in employment, the number of discouraged work-seekers, like the number of unemployed, decreased by 447,000,” Stats SA said.</p>
												<p>“The majority of those who moved out of these three categories moved into the category of not economically active for reasons other than discouragement, which increased by 5.6 million between the two quarters.”</p>
												<p>This is illustrated in the graph below:</p>

												<h3>Official unemployment rate</h3>
												<p>The official unemployment rate has declined over the period, according to Stats SA, from 30.1% in Q1 2020 to 23.3% in Q2 2020. This is the lowest unemployment rate recorded since Q3 2009.</p>
												<p>It is important to note, however, that the official unemployment rate is calculated using the number of persons who are employed and unemployed, and does not include discouraged work-seekers or people who are not economically active.</p>
												<p>“However, the expanded unemployment rate increased by 2.3 percentage points in Q2 2020 compared to Q1 2020, reflective of the fact that people were available for work but did not actively look for work,” Stats SA said.</p>
												<p>“The unemployment rate according to the expanded definition increased in all provinces except in the Free State, where it decreased by 3.3 percentage points.”</p>
												<p>“When asked why they did not look for work, most people cited the national lockdown / COVID-19 / coronavirus as the main reason for not actively looking for work,” it said.</p>
												<p>The decrease unemployment rate is illustrated below:</p>

												<h3>Lockdown factors</h3>
												<p>Stats SA noted that many people did not look for work due to the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
												<p>“When asked why they did not look for work, most people cited the national lockdown / COVID-19 / coronavirus as the main reason for not actively looking for work,” it said.</p>
												<p>Of the 14.2 million people who were employed during the quarter, 58.1% were expected to work during the national lockdown by the companies they work for.</p>
												<p>There were 173,000 employed persons who were expected to work during the national lockdown but could not do any work during that period.</p>
												<p>“About 76.3% cited the national lockdown as the main reason for not actually working while the rest indicated that they did not work due to health reasons (10.2%); family responsibility (3.5%); or shift work arrangements (10.0%),” Stats SA said.</p>
												<p>11.5 million employed people continued to receive pay during the lockdown, and around one in five had a reduction in their pay during the period.</p>

										<h2>How SMEs can build great customer experiences</h2>
										
										<div class="post_desc">
										
											
												<p><em>By Dumisani Moyo, Head of Mid-Market: Southern Africa at SAP</em></p>
												<p>Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) take for granted the level of investment required to build and maintain a good reputation.</p>
												<p>There’s growing acknowledgement of the importance of becoming a Customer Experience (CX) leader to help build that reputation, but too few are taking appropriate steps to embrace and prioritise a true CX culture.</p>
												<p>Delivering exceptional CX requires that every part of the business is in sync and enabled by the right technology.</p>
												<p>CX is an important part of managing and growing a company, yet, it is one of the most understated business priorities. Customer service is the level of service that customers expect to receive in exchange for their money.</p>
												<p>CX, on the other hand, is how customers feel when they interact with a business. From researching the product to the actual purchase and use, it spans the entire customer buying journey.</p>
												<p>Customers, now more than ever, will never return if the initial interaction is poor. CX is therefore a key element of customer retention – and a key differentiator.</p>
												<h3><strong>What’s the fuss about CX?</strong></h3>
												<p>CX encapsulates the holistic perception of a customer’s experience with a company. It is the result of every interaction, from researching the product to purchasing and using it.</p>
												<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/modal-offers/econsultancy_digital_trends_2019_report.html?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_content=28_September_2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Digital Trends report</a></strong> found that companies that prioritised technology were 64% more likely to meet and exceed their business priorities.</p>
												<p>According to the same report, 36% of large companies are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve their data analytics.</p>
												<p>These companies believe that data is a game changer, and that its ownership, control and use is a strong source of sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
												<p>There is a misconception that investing in CX is expensive and delivers little return.</p>
												<p>A recent <strong><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PWC report</a></strong> found that satisfied customers are willing to pay a premium of up to 16%; proving that positive experiences lead to greater loyalty.</p>
												<p>In addition, around 32% of consumers reported that after just one bad experience, they were most likely to abandon a brand they had preferred.</p>
												<p>These data points demonstrate the importance of intentionally pursuing a customer-centric strategy. The net impact is customer satisfaction, higher sales and stronger long-term customer relationships.</p>
												<p>In difficult times, such as the tough economic climate caused by the COVID pandemic, CX is at the heart of sustaining a business.</p>
												<h3><strong>Steps to improving CX</strong></h3>
												<p>SMEs often juggle multiple priorities with limited resources. Balancing operational priorities and implementing CX strategies can be a real challenge. Here are some practical ways of improving CX for SMEs:</p>
												<ol>
												<li><strong>Implement additional support channels to make it easier for customers to interact with the company</strong>. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for automation, SMEs can provide self-service options that make it easier for customers to track their orders independently, enabling a self-help approach that improves efficiencies and lowers costs.</li>
												<li><strong>Prioritise your website as a different way of interacting with customers 24/7</strong>. SMEs that did not have online stores could not continue trading under lockdown conditions. Moreover, adding a Frequently Asked Questions section can empower customers to be self-sufficient, allowing the company to refocus valuable human resources on income-generating activities and innovation.</li>
												<li><strong>Adopt technology-driven query management processes that are customer-centric and cost-effective</strong>. Using AI, SMEs can develop chatbots that handle repetitive functions such as order delivery queries.</li>
												</ol>
												<p><strong>How technology enables great CX</strong></p>
												<p>A recent <strong><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/lp/total-economic-impact-of-qualtrics/#:~:text=The%20Total%20Economic%20Impact%20of%20Qualtrics%20CustomerXM&amp;text=Benefits%20equaling%20%2438.4M%2C%20with,previous%20surveys%20and%20analytics%20tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a></strong> by Qualtrics and Forrester Consulting that looked at Return on Investment from deploying CX solutions produced some interesting findings:</p>
												<ul>
												<li><strong>Customer care</strong>: companies were able to gather actionable insights that enabled them to institute measures that reduced the cost of incident management by shifting incidents to a self-help platform.</li>
												<li><strong>Customer retention</strong>: aligning the company on key metrics and shifting to a customer-centric view of data had a positive impact on CX. Companies reported an increase in customer satisfaction and more personalised experiences and customer buying journeys that led to higher customer retention.</li>
												<li><strong>Data and customer-centric culture</strong>: companies were able to create standard, consistent, and trusted data sources across departments, resulting in a unified view and measure of CX throughout the company.</li>
												<li><strong>Business outcomes</strong>: companies were able to identify things that needed to change quickly. While some seemed mundane, they had a meaningful impact on customers and resulted in quick wins.</li>
												<li><strong>Better insight and decision-making</strong>: companies benefited from having a centralised database for all customer insights, enabling them to move quicker and provide better insights for decision making.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>CX is about proactively managing and curating the entire customer buying journey to ensure that customers walk away with a feel-good experience.</p>
												<p>Delivering a positive CX requires a customer-centric strategy that is underpinned by the right technology investment. Technology empowers all companies, of all sizes, to connect with current and prospective customers.</p>
												<p>SMEs now have the ability to accurately predict future needs of their customers, enabling them to be proactive and attentive to ever-changing conditions. In an increasingly unpredictable and competitive business environment, the emotional connection between the customer and the brand can be the difference between survival and prosperity.</p>
												<p>In a recent survey by Oxford Economics and SAP, 39% of small and medium sized companies said that improving customer experiences is their top priority over the next three years – even ahead of increasing profits or reducing costs.</p>
												<p>I thought it would be interesting for you to discover how these companies are managing customer experiences through improved technology and organizational strategies by reading the <strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/africa/cmp/dg/sme-cx/index.html?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_content=28_September_2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study here</a></strong>.</p>

										<h2>The 4 biggest technology challenges for South African businesses in 2020</h2>
										
										<div class="post_desc">
										
												<p>There have been many challenges this year, especially in the areas of business and economic activity.</p>
												<p>Never before have we seen such a massive impact on how we do business, caused by all the ripple effects due to the global pandemic.</p>
												<p>Of all the sectors and industries that have withstood these changes, the information and communications technology sector have probably experienced the most significant seismic shifts.</p>

												</ul>
												<h3><strong>Fast changes bring fresh challenges</strong></h3>
												<p>Being clear about the challenges ahead and how to face them head-on, will be the difference between being capsized by change or thriving through the times.</p>

												<h3>1. Managing data security and privacy</h3>
												<p>Whether its the protection of business data, or putting mechanisms in place to protect the privacy of clients and users, security management has become one of the core focuses and challenges of the modern era.</p>
												<p>Making sure safety and security is the topmost priority has become one of the core functions of any information and communications technology entity.</p>
												<h3><strong>2. Merging the old with the new</strong></h3>
												<p>CIOs and IT leaders will face a growing challenge in their digital transformation journeys: Merging legacy technologies with modern technologies.</p>
												<p>The fact is, many businesses still rely on legacy systems. Not all of these systems can be easily replaced.</p>
												<p>The challenge facing CIOs and IT leaders: How can you merge legacy and modern systems, without sacrificing function or security?</p>
												<h3><strong>3. Ensuring reliable IT systems and connectivity</strong></h3>
												<p>Whether it’s due to lockdown or load-shedding, many businesses have been experiencing lapses in their fixed-line connections.</p>
												<p>Being unexpectedly offline in a time when ongoing sales and transactions might mean the difference between staying open and indefinitely closing shop, has become an all too real scenario for many business owners.</p>
												<h3><strong>4. Facing the skills and talent gap</strong></h3>
												<p>As trends and technology shift on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, it is hardly possible to stay updated with all the latest skills and competencies needed to address all the emerging needs of the modern business.</p>
												<p>Whether it is through upskilling, automation of outsourcing, businesses need to put strategies in place to not be left behind in a rapidly evolving environment.</p>

										<h2>The basic economics of spending R10 in South Africa – and the importance of supporting local</h2>
										
										<div class="post_desc">
											<div class="entry-content">
												<p>As South Africa battles the twin effects of illness and lockdown, the time is ripe to consider carefully how and where South Africans spend their money, <a href="https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/841/207827.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a> Catherine Wijnberg, director and founder of the Fetola Foundation.</p>
												<hr>
												<p>There are those who have lots, and those who have little, yet if people understood the power of a single Rand to change the future of the country, everyone might spend it very differently.</p>
												<p>In 2015, a paper on the negative impact of shopping malls on local economies used research from India, USA and South Africa to explain how the arrival of a glamorous mall sucks the money out of the local community and pulls it away, into the coffers of big business.</p>
												<p>The counterargument in favour of malls is that small, rural and township dwellers deserve first world shopping, which provide local jobs and convenience, entertainment and better pricing than traditional high street shops.</p>
												<p>Most township residents would certainly vote for glorious first world shopping and low prices, at least in the first year. By year three however they might notice, for example in the small town of Grabouw or Knysna perhaps, how the main street is deserted. Small businesses that had thrived there for generations are now reduced to mere shells of their former self and replaced by those selling counterfeit, imported T-shirts or cheap bling.</p>
												<p>The money circulating locally has dwindled, small businesses have closed, many jobs have disappeared, and local wealth departed along with them.</p>
												<p>By year four or five, the shopping malls also suffer as local buying power is depressed along with the lower employment rate, resulting in an overall downturn in spending.</p>
												<p>For those who need more convincing, it is important to look at the maths of it. In basic terms it works like this – in the days before the arrival of malls and major chain stores, Mary would spend R10 at the baker; who (assuming a 10% profit retention); would spend R9 at the butcher; who would spend R8 at the tailor; who would spend R7 at the school; who would spend R6 at the stationery store; who would spend R5 at the farmer’s market and so on. A simple illustration of how one R10 note can create wealth ten times over.</p>
												<p><strong>Local wealth</strong></p>
												<p>In today’s reality (especially in poor communities such as the Eastern Cape where up to 60% of the population live off social grants and there is very little local economic activity), Mary gets R10. She spends R7 at the local Boxer store where R2 of her money goes to a local shop wages, R5 goes to national suppliers elsewhere in the country and R1 goes to shareholders at the JSE.</p>
												<p>She also spends R3 to buy data at MTN, so all that money goes to MTN headquartered in Gauteng. None of her R10 circulates in the local economy so no one other than Mary benefits from it. Money in equals money out and there is zero local wealth creation. Mary’s R10 didn’t stay in the local community for even one day.</p>
												<p>This is not just a South African phenomenon though. In America: “Currently, a dollar circulates in Asian communities for a month, in Jewish communities approximately 20 days and white communities 17 days. How long does a dollar circulate in the black community? 6 hours!</p>
												<p>African American buying power is at 1.1 trillion; and yet only 2 cents of every dollar an African American spends in this country goes to black owned businesses.”</p>
												<p>This indicates that this is more than a mere economics problem, but a social and cultural one – why do some communities care for each other, by shopping local and others not? Is it because South Africans simply haven’t understood the power of that rand in their hand, or is something else at play?</p>
												<p><strong>Why supporting local matters</strong></p>
												<p>It is time to ask the question of rich and poor alike: “If I knew this R10 could change the lives of ten other families in my community simply by spending it locally in a small spaza shop, a corner café or a farmer’s market rather than at a mall, a chain retail store or a chain restaurant then why am I not doing that?”</p>
												<p>By supporting small independent businesses in our community, encouraging citizens to trade with other local businesses using local collaboration platforms, local discount cards, and pleasurable local entertainment will build stronger, supportive human communities, generate local jobs, and ensure that our money circulates so that ten families can benefit from every R10 that enters the system.</p>
												<p>Shopping malls can also develop more viable long-term strategies such as those showcased by the V&amp;A Waterfront in Cape Town, who have improved their lasting appeal and built a more sustainable and healthy surrounding economy by actively encouraging a diverse mixture of smaller businesses, and ensuring their survival with business support in a win, win, win for the mall, the small shops and consumers.</p>
												<p>Recovery and regrowth of South Africa’s economy is our responsibility; now that you know the power of your money, where are you going to spend your next rand?</p>
